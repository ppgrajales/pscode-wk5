// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If a number is divisible by 2 display "even"
Else display "odd"  

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

//start//
Read num1
Read num2
Read num3
Read num4
Read num5

//calculate the average//
add all numbers together
Divide the sum by total numbers 
=ave

//minimun and maximum//
min= identify the smallest num
max= identify the largest num

//results//
Print avg
Print min
Print max
